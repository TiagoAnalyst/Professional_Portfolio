## Welcome to my project: World wide meat consumption

I always wondered the size of our meat consumption "footprint" and, by thus, the reason of doing this project.

This project summarizes the world wide meat consumption since 1961 up to 2021 and raw data is analysed, cleansed and manipulated using SQL server. Data is then uploaded into Tableau Public, where a dashboard was created for data visualisation [(Link here)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tiago.santos4164/viz/Meatproductionpercapita_Worldwide/Maindashboard)

Data source: [OurWorldinData.org](https://ourworldindata.org)

### Main outcomes (insights)
- In 2021, the amount of meat produced in Asia was the equivalement of total amounts produced by Europe, Africa, North America and Oceania together.
- In 2021, China was the world's biggest meat producer. However, New Zealand led the top as the world's biggest meat producer per capita.
- Raw data didn't specify the type of meat produced (e.g. bovine, poultry)
