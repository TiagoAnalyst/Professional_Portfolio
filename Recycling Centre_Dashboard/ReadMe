# Welcome to my first dashboard created: Recycling Centre  

This dashboard summarizes the main KPIs for each waste category managed on this recycling centre. To put it into context, this recycling centre is composed by two distinct areas with different features: 

- **Household waste Recycling centre**: used by residents & charities 
- **Waste Transfer Station** : used by businesses and waste collections vehicles

In terms of operations, both areas has different waste management processes: 
- specific waste stream bins in the **Household  Waste Recycling Centre** are loaded, transported and emptied in the **Waste Transfer Station** (waste collections done in large scale, with bulkers truck) whilst other waste stream bins are collected directly from this area.
- All waste streams from the **Waste Transfer Station** are collected directly from this area

The number of waste streams in the area for residents is considerebly higher compared with the other area due to space limitations.
