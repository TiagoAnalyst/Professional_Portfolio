# Hi there! And welcome :) 
I'm Tiago, a Project Manager working in Operations at West London Waste Authority (WLWA) where my mission is:

- improving how West London recycling centres are operating;
- identifying opportunities to deliver financial savings.

In order to be sucessful with my challenging mission, I'm heavily realiable on

**...DATA...and more DATA....detailed, accurate and clean!**

**Unfortunately, the reality is quite the opposite!** 

To overcome this data issues,I mostly use Microsoft Excel for data cleansing, manipulation and modelling for further dashboarding. Also, I work closely with WLWA MI team to improve all aspects of data such as standardization and have been learning PowerBI to support them with expanding the number of data visualisation reports. 

Outside of work, I'm actively learning new data analytics tools such as Python and mirroring developed projects and creating my own data projects using SQL and Tableau

Besides learning new tools, I heavily focus on learning data communication techniques either by data storytelling, translating data into non-technical audiences and the importance of colours in dashboarding. I also make sure to share my finding on social media (LinkedIN) and in this way, support the data analytics/science communities. 

You'll notice that my projects are diverse in subject, approach and source data. Some of them are very technical and if you have any questions, please [drop me a message through my portfolio website](https://tiagodataanalyst.github.io/Portfolio_website/#contact)

I'm currently re-focusing the scope of this portfolio and updating it with newer work more indicative of my current interests, skills and operational background.

If you're looking to get a sense of my technical and problem solving abilities, please start with the following projects:
- Recycling Centre Dashboard, developed using Microsoft Excel
- Booking system dashboard, developed using Microsoft Excel and Python script (to be uploaded very soon)
- Worlwide meat consumption project, developed using SQL server and Tableau

Thank you very much for your interest in my work. 

Best regards,
Tiago Santos
